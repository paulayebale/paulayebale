             <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p> For Over 3 years Hope for Prisoners assists with reentry by providing the formerly incarcerated long-term support and services as they work to reclaim their lives,  families and standing in the community. We give them hope. Hope changes lives.</p>
            <p>Founder PAUL AYEBALE found himself returning to his community after spending time in prison and experienced firsthand the same challenges most face when they are released. He realized there was a lack of long-term support and guidance for those who learned from their mistakes and had a genuine desire to change the direction of their lives. From his personal experience and his passion to help those facing the same challenges he overcame, HOPE for Prisoners was born.</p>
